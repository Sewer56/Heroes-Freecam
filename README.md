# About This Project

The following is a very simple; fixed; free camera implementation that can rotate on all three axis (it can roll!) with additional support for the following features:

- Freeze Scene
- Toggle HUD
- Teleport
- Movement/Rotation Sensitivity

As this was created for the sole purpose of taking screenshots; there are not many customization features; the controls are fixed and primarily designed to be operated using a controller with two analog sticks.

# Demo
